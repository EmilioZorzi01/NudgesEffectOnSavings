# The effect of nudges on people's saving behaviour

## Project Overview

This study investigates the efficacy of nudges in affecting people’s saving behaviors, with a specific focus on
the saving rate. Through an experiment conducted via online survey, we tested the impact of simple
suggestion on individuals’ saving choices. This research provides tangible evidence of the potential of
nudges in promoting saving and suggests possible implications for the design of public policies and savings
promotion tools.
